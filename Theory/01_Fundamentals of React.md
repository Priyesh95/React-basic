ðŸ“Œ What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). It was developed by Facebook (now Meta) and is widely used for building scalable and fast web applications.
âš¡ Why Use React?
Component-Based: React allows you to break the UI into reusable components.
Declarative: You describe the UI, and React updates the DOM for you.
Virtual DOM: React uses a lightweight virtual representation of the DOM to update only the necessary parts of the UI, improving performance.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Makes state management predictable and easier to debug.
Strong Ecosystem: Supported by tools like React Router, Redux, and a huge developer community.
